The CRS is the definition of the real-world system in which a rasterâ€™s pixels are located (read more [here](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/03-crs/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "If we ignore the CRS and work with the 2D numpy `ndarray` we are essentially ignoring where the pixels are located on the earth's surface. We can see that in the last plot - the axes are simply numbered horizontally from 0 on the left and vertically from 0 at the top. We can see we have ~250 rows and ~180 columns. \n",

    "Ignoring the CRS might be fine for some things (e.g. if you're just working with a single raster) but it's important when we're working with multiple data files to ensure everything aligns properly. For example, below we are going to use some polygons with the raster data; the CRS is important to define where the data in each file are located and therefore how the data align.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember from above that the CRS information is actually contained in the `DatasetReader` object. When we plot using the rasterio `show` with the `DatasetReader` object, we can see that the CRS is being used - _the co-ordinates on the axis are different from when using just the 2D data_:"
